Creating a machine learning (ML) emulator for microphysics in the “Community Earth System Model (CESM)” is an advanced task that involves coupling data-driven ML methods with physically based climate models. This guide walks you through the steps to develop a microphysics ML emulator for CESM, focusing on key elements like data preparation, model development, integration, and testing. The example will assume you're emulating a cloud microphysics scheme, but the approach can be generalized.
